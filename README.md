<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm mervet magdy</h1>
<h3 align="center">Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with a range of tools and technologies, including Apache Web Server, debugging and troubleshooting complex systems, interfacing design and implementation, and understanding client requirements. I have also worked extensively with Android software development, software architecture, and design patterns and principles. My commitment to producing clean code and fluency in C, C++, C# are also strengths that I bring to the table. I understand the importance of following the SDLC processes, and I have a deep understanding of API integration. My experience with Firebase, Dart, and Flutter, as well as state management (Getx-Bloc), local databases (sqlite-hive), and shared preferences have given me a solid foundation in mobile app development. My proficiency in Figma has also enabled me to design interfaces that meet user requirements and are visually appealing.</h3>
